Current Status: Website fully functional, Google Bucket has the chosen music, music page can access and
stream the music from the google bucket, groups were created and permissions edited to permit access to
admin group and restrict access to user group. Crontab managed backup script. The backup script saves the
back up both in the lilgunnerclouse home directory and as copy in the Google Bucket.

Things to do still:
	Finetune website for visual appeal
	Create README for backup script
	Create Power Point for presentation
	Record presentation with demo
	Finish short document to list group members and who's server the project is on
	Submit recording and documents
	GET AN A+ :)
